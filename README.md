# 🗒️ Dev Notes

### Monorepo

This monorepo consists two very small packages:

- `chrome`: The Google Chrome extension
- `api`: A simple API for getting photos from Unsplash

### Unsplash

Unfortunately, Unsplash retired `source.unsplash.com` which
this extension used exclusively. Unsplash now requires using
their API which itself dictates we keep hidden all API keys.
So, yes, a monorepo which includes an API is hilarious
overkill for a god damn new tab browser extension.

### Deno

This entire project would have been in Deno, but to keep the
Chrome extension in TypeScript, a build step was necessary.
The current best options were Vite and Esbuild, neither of
which worked, without issue, in Deno. Vite works in Node.js, so
here we are. As a result, this monorepo requires both
Node.js and Deno.

## What's with the name?

It's a play on the word "Kairos," Greek for the right or opportune time.
